## Overview

The PR057H371C4RM (Prosthetic Arm) project is a simpler mechanical replacement for a lost limb, designed primarily to restore basic functionality.

## Goals

- **Design and Development:** Create a robust mechanical design that ensures durability and reliability. [A]
- **Functional Prototypes:** Develop prototypes that can perform basic tasks such as gripping, lifting, and holding objects. [A]
- **User Interface:** Implement an intuitive user interface that allows easy control of the prosthetic arm. [B]
- **Integration with Sensors:** Integrate various sensors to provide feedback and improve the control and precision of movements. [B]
- **Customization:** Allow customization options to cater to different user needs and preferences. [B]

## Future Work

- Detailed mechanical and electronic design plans. [70]
- Prototyping and testing phases. [20]
- User feedback and iteration. [00]
